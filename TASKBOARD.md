# LLM Workbench - Hot Taskboard

**Current focus:** S-014/TK-001 is ready to reconcile main ancestry into integration through an audited merge PR.
**Owner:** Kayden (executive); agents execute assigned slices
**Last updated:** 2026-07-16

This dashboard contains current execution state only. Use
`node tools/spec-workbench.mjs next` to select work and `show S-###` to load its
requirements. Durable requirements, decisions, acceptance criteria, and proof
live in the linked spec. Commands live in `RUNBOOK.md`.

## Owner Decisions

No open owner decisions. New decisions stay here only while they block an
active spec; the resolved decision moves into that spec.
