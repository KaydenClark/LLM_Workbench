# [PROJECT_NAME] Memory

> Generated from LLM Workbench v[HARNESS_VERSION]. This is the room brain: the
> canonical, human-editable memory router for this project, kept at
> `workbench/wiki/MEMORY.md`. Start here and follow the smallest relevant
> link instead of browsing folders or searching.

This router holds durable room memory only: context, decision-history
pointers, and routing. It never duplicates live task state; it routes to it.

## Source Precedence

1. Verified runtime and this room's live controls: `AGENTS.md`, `BLUEPRINT.md`,
   the assigned stable spec, `TASKBOARD.md`, and `RUNBOOK.md`.
2. Maintained notes routed from this file.
3. `archive/` and generated material.

When sources disagree, verify the higher-authority source and repair the stale
note (`AGENTS.md` -> State Resolution). The wiki is a map, not a Governance
Plane: it routes to Canon, Grounding, and verified Actuality and authorizes
nothing.

## Leaving The Wiki

| Go to | For |
|---|---|
| [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md) | Authority, scope, safety, and the work loop |
| [BLUEPRINT.md](../../BLUEPRINT.md) | Product map, architecture, and the spec catalog |
| [LEXICON.md](../../LEXICON.md) | Shared terms, the Governance Core, and design-concept routing |
| [TASKBOARD.md](../../TASKBOARD.md) | Current execution state |
| `workbench/specs/` | Stable capability records, acceptance, evidence, and proof |
| [RUNBOOK.md](../../RUNBOOK.md) | Exact operating and verification commands |
| [SCHEMA.md](SCHEMA.md) | Wiki CRUD, metadata, sensitivity, and freshness rules |
| [design-concepts/](design-concepts/README.md) | Owner-directed articles explaining durable design models |
| [guidebooks/](guidebooks/) | Ordered procedures that outgrew the Runbook |

## Routing

| Question | Read first |
|---|---|
| [QUESTION THIS ROOM'S MEMORY ANSWERS] | [[NOTE NAME]] |
| [ANOTHER DURABLE QUESTION] | [[ANOTHER NOTE NAME]] |

Add a row only when a durable note exists to route to. A young room may have an
empty table; that is fine. Grow flat notes beside this router and inside the
declared collections; only `archive/` may nest.

## Up-Link

Inside a larger deployment, name the deployment wiki's pointer note for this
room here and keep the pair resolvable in both directions. A standalone room
leaves this section as a single line: `Standalone room; no deployment wiki.`
