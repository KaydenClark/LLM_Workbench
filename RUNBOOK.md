# [PROJECT_NAME] - Runbook

**Last reviewed:** [YYYY-MM-DD] ← update whenever any section content changes  
**Runtime owner:** [user / agent / service owner]  
**Environment:** [local / LAN / staging / production]

This file explains how to operate the project. It should be boring, exact, and executable.

## Prerequisites

Required tools:

- [tool and version]
- [tool and version]

Required accounts/services:

- [service]
- [service]

Required local files:

- `[path]` - [purpose / how to create safely]

## Environment Configuration

Create local config from the example:

```bash
[COPY_ENV_COMMAND]
```

Required variables:

| Variable | Purpose | Secret? | Example / Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `[ENV_VAR]` | [purpose] | [yes/no] | [placeholder only] |

Rules:

- Do not commit real `.env` files, tokens, local databases, logs, or private data.
- Keep secrets server-side or local-only.
- Prefer degraded states over fake data when an external source is unavailable.

## Install

```bash
[INSTALL_COMMAND]
```

Expected result:

- [what success looks like]

## Run Locally

```bash
[RUN_COMMAND]
```

Open:

- [local URL, CLI command, or service endpoint]

Expected result:

- [health response / visible UI / log line]

## Test And Build

Fast check:

```bash
[FAST_TEST_COMMAND]
```

Full verification:

```bash
[FULL_TEST_COMMAND]
[BUILD_COMMAND]
[LINT_OR_AUDIT_COMMAND]
```

Expected result:

- [pass condition without hardcoding stale counts unless recently verified in ROADMAP]

## Data Operations

Use this section only if the project has seed data, migrations, imports, local databases, or generated feeds.

Seed/import:

```bash
[SEED_OR_IMPORT_COMMAND]
```

Migration:

```bash
[MIGRATION_COMMAND]
```

Backup/restore:

```bash
[BACKUP_OR_RESTORE_COMMAND]
```

Safety rules:

- [what data this command may modify]
- [what it must never modify]
- [how to verify counts/schema/output]

## Deployment Or Startup

Use this section only if the project has deployment, LaunchAgent, cron, scheduler, or service startup behavior.

Start/restart:

```bash
[START_OR_RESTART_COMMAND]
```

Stop:

```bash
[STOP_COMMAND]
```

Logs:

```bash
[LOG_COMMAND]
```

Expected healthy state:

- [process, endpoint, scheduler, or deployment check]

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Check | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Symptom] | [cause] | `[command/check]` | [fix] |

## Recovery And Rollback

If a change fails:

1. [rollback step]
2. [verification step]
3. [documentation or escalation step]

Do not delete data, reset databases, rewrite history, or rotate secrets unless the user explicitly approves that action.

## Operational Proof

If a command in this runbook changed durable project state, append a row to the `ROADMAP.md` Verification Log. For routine local runs that do not change state, a final response note is enough.
